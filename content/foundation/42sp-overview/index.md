summary: "No teachers, no classes — just problems to solve. How 42SP built the low-level discipline that makes reliable AI systems possible."

**42 São Paulo** is where the foundation was built — no teachers, no classes, just increasingly complex problems and peers to solve them with.

## Core disciplines

- **C Programming:** Manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, data structures implemented from scratch. No abstractions to hide behind.
- **Unix/Linux:** Shell scripting, process management, system calls, inter-process communication. Understanding the OS as a tool, not a black box.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, graph traversal — all implemented in C, all optimized by hand.
- **Collaboration:** Peer evaluation, code review, collective debugging. Learning to read code as well as you write it.

## Why it matters for AI

Every abstraction leaks. LLM inference runs on GPUs managed by kernels. Agent orchestration depends on process scheduling and memory. Understanding what happens at the systems level — how memory is allocated, how processes communicate, how the kernel arbitrates resources — makes you a better engineer at every layer of the stack.

When an AI pipeline fails at 3 AM, you need to debug it at the systems level. That's what 42SP trained for.

This foundation is what makes building reliable, production-grade AI systems possible.
