From **bare-metal C** to **autonomous AI agents** — I build systems that think, adapt, and ship.

Trained at **42 São Paulo** in the discipline of low-level systems engineering. Now architecting **Agentic AI** at **FIAP**, where multi-agent workflows turn complexity into automated pipelines.

This is the lab where systems thinking meets intelligent automation.
