This is the first entry in **Runtime Insights** — a space for technical writing on AI engineering, agentic systems, and the low-level foundations that make it all work.

## What to expect

- **Agentic AI:** Multi-agent orchestration with CrewAI, LangChain, and custom frameworks — how autonomous systems solve real problems.
- **Technical Deep-Dives:** From transformer internals to production deployment patterns. How things work under the hood.
- **Systems Thinking:** Lessons from C, Unix, and memory management that still apply when building reliable AI infrastructure.
- **Project Breakdowns:** Every project in The Agentic Lab will get a detailed write-up here — architecture decisions, trade-offs, and results.

## Why "Runtime"?

Because ideas are compile-time. Shipping is runtime. This blog is about what happens when code meets the real world — the execution, the edge cases, the optimization loops.

The runtime is live. Let's build.
