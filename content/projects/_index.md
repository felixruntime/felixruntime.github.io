description: "AI agent systems — designed, built, and deployed. From FIAP coursework to production-ready experiments."

This is where AI agents are built and tested. Each project here is a working system — multi-agent pipelines, autonomous workflows, and intelligent automation built during my AI engineering studies at FIAP.

Every project links to its source code on GitHub and live demos on Hugging Face Spaces.
