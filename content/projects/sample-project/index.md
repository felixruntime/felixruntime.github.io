summary: "A CrewAI-powered pipeline where specialized agents collaborate on research, data analysis, and report generation."
---

A multi-agent system built with **CrewAI** where specialized agents collaborate autonomously — one researches, another analyzes, a third generates reports. No human in the loop.

## Architecture

- **Research Agent:** Gathers and synthesizes information from multiple sources.
- **Analysis Agent:** Processes data, identifies patterns, extracts insights.
- **Reporting Agent:** Produces structured, readable output from raw analysis.
