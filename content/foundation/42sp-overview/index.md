**42 São Paulo** is where the foundation was built — no teachers, no classes, just problems to solve and peers to learn with.

## Core disciplines

- **C Programming:** Manual memory management, pointers, data structures from scratch.
- **Unix/Linux:** Shell scripting, process management, system calls.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, graph traversal — all implemented in C.
- **Collaboration:** Peer evaluation, code review, collective problem-solving.

## Why it matters

Every abstraction leaks. Understanding what happens at the systems level — how memory is allocated, how processes communicate, how the kernel schedules work — makes you a better engineer at every layer of the stack.

This foundation is what makes building reliable AI systems possible.
