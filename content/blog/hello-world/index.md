This is the first entry in **Runtime Insights** — a space for technical writing on AI engineering, agentic systems, and the low-level foundations that make it all work.

## What to expect

- **AI Strategy:** How agentic architectures solve real problems — CrewAI, LangChain, and beyond.
- **Technical Deep-Dives:** From transformer internals to production deployment patterns.
- **Systems Thinking:** Lessons from C, Unix, and memory management that still apply in the age of LLMs.

The runtime is live. Let's build.
